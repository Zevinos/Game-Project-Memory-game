# Memory game project üÉè

First ever project on github.

## What is it ?

It's a game that i made as the first project for the IRONHACK Bootcamp ! 

The objective was to create a browser game in Java Script, HTLM and CSS.

## Why did you choose this game ?

For me when i hear browser games i instantly think of games like this one 
because the only games that i played on browser were memory ones.üòÖ

## Features

- Super cards with different Programming language logos
- A random generation of the cards 
- a countdown timer that will force the players to speed run the game !
- Some little sounds
